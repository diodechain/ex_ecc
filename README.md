# ex_ecc

This is an Elixir language port of the python library py_ecc from the Ethereum project.

It's a file-to-file port so to make it easier to compare the code and understand the differences as well as to incorporate new changes.

Same goes for the tests.

# Port notes

Original python files are in py_ecc/ and tests/ the new ported files are in lib/ and test/ correspondingly.
