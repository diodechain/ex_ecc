This directory contains an unfinished port of py_ecc from python to elixir now named ex_ecc. Compare the existing .py and existing .ex files to discover any modules missing from the port. Then create the missing files by converting the python code into elixir module code. Don't re-create modules that already exist. When that is done run `mix compile` and fix all errors and warnings from this until compilation is clean.

This directory contains an unfinished port of py_ecc from python to elixir now named ex_ecc. Let's focus on the tests. There are two test directories test/ for the elixir tests and /tests with the original python tests. Please port the python tests over to elixir code and add test libraries as needed. Then run the tests using mix test.

This directory contains an unfinished port of py_ecc from python to elixir now named ex_ecc. We want to fix bls12_381 first. Run `./test.sh` and then fix the occuring warnings one by one until no more warnings occurs and there are no more failures. Fix the errors one by one, each time running `./test.sh` again after a change. In order to fix them look boot at the test case and implementations. For reference consult the corresponding original python files and ensure that the implementations and tests are behaving as intended in the original. Keep iterating on this until `./test.sh` does not show any errors anymore and don't ask me but keep going.


Redo this elixir module port in the same way as the port in @bn128_curve.ex . Don't port type enforcement.
